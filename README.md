# LinkGame
Simple imitation of popular Link Game. 
Summer project(2014.7) of Freshman. 

Note: 

 1.Resource files (pic&sound) get large after rcc-ed to .cpp files, which may cause out-of-heap-space-error when compiled with VS2013. 
 Split .qrc to 3 files to avoid this problem. 

 2.Qt program requires .dll files to run. In this case:
	Qt5Core.dll
	Qt5Gui.dll
	Qt5Multimedia.dll
	Qt5Network.dll
	Qt5Widget.dll
 are required for release version.

 3.The game was developed with only half-year programming experience on, one person in a month, and only for school project purpose. 
 I now upload it here as backup. No future intention to update or write doc.
